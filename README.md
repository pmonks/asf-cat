# asf-cat

A micro library that provides a Clojure implementation of the [Apache Software Foundation's 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

## System Requirements

This library uses [`lice-comb`](https://github.com/pmonks/lice-comb), so has the same system requirements as that library.

## Installation

`asf-cat` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.github.pmonks/asf-cat).

### Trying it Out

#### Clojure CLI

```shell
$ clj -Sdeps '{:deps {com.github.pmonks/asf-cat {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}'
```

#### Leiningen

```shell
$ lein try com.github.pmonks/asf-cat
```

#### deps-try

```shell
$ deps-try com.github.pmonks/asf-cat
```

### Demo

```clojure
(require '[asf-cat.api :as asf])

### Developer Workflow

This project uses the [git-flow branching strategy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the permanent branches are called `release` and `dev`.  Any changes to the `release` branch are considered a release and auto-deployed (JARs to Clojars, API docs to GitHub Pages, etc.).

For this reason, **all development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in temporary branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs from forked repos must also be submitted against `dev`; the `release` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `release` will be rejected.

### Build Tasks

`asf-cat` uses [`tools.build`](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build). You can get a list of available tasks by running:

```
clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc
```

Of particular interest are:

* `clojure -T:build test` - run the unit tests
* `clojure -T:build lint` - run the linters (clj-kondo and eastwood)
* `clojure -T:build ci` - run the full CI suite (check for outdated dependencies, run the unit tests, run the linters)
* `clojure -T:build install` - build the JAR and install it locally (e.g. so you can test it with downstream code)

Please note that the `deploy` task is restricted to the core development team (and will not function if you run it yourself).
